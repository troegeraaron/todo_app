# Python Todo App

I made this app as a simple practice. It isn't a throw-away practice app...I actually use it. 

## How to use

My current version of python is 3.12.3, so I know the app works there. I can't say backwards compatibilty
works. 

This app is a command based app. Very simple, you add todo items, complete them, and then delete them. 

The todo list is saved as a CSV file. The app creates that file on first run. If you decide to put the
app in the system path, the file will be created at your current loction. I will change that at some point
but wanted to give a heads up for the v1 app.

## Why?

I didn't want to just create another web based todo app that required a database or client side storage.
I wanted to practice some python, but wanted a simple, yet useful app. I'm also learning vim and neovim
along with tmux, so I thought to create a terminal based app.
